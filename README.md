# Welcome to the Bobifier!

Recently I was having a good time with my friend, where we wanted to just fool around. Our main Topic was the [Spongebob Mocking Meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/mocking-spongebob) and the associated text formatting coming with it!:

So I came up with this really basic static site that lets you "Bobify" (patent pending) your Text inputs!

You can try it out for yourself [here](https://bobify.itswavs.com)

This is just a meme repository. I am happy for any feedback I can get, but just don't take it too seriously ðŸ™ŒðŸ˜‚
